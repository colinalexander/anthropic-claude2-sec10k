SEC 10-K Company Analysis

## [July 2023 Hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/WLszTLRL4ftfhEqBtKGD)</strong></h1>

This project involves analyzing key sections of SEC 10-K annual report filings for public companies. Claude 2 is provided with text extracted from the following 10-K sections:

- Business
- Risk Factors  
- Management's Discussion and Analysis (MDA)
- Legal Proceedings
- Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants

Claude's role is to provide summaries of each section, along with a sentiment analysis giving each a continuous score between -1 and +1, indicating overall negative to positive tone.

For the MDA section, the chatbot is given the MDA text for the current and prior two fiscal years. The analysis will summarize the key changes over this three year period. 

The goal is to extract insights from these critical sections of 10-K filings to allow for quick analysis of the company's business, risks, operations and financial position. The continuous sentiment scoring aims to highlight concerning negative tones or positive optimistic tones in the disclosures. Analyzing MDAs over timeframes can identify trends in the company's performance.

This type of 10-K analysis could be useful for investment research, due diligence, or tracking trends across an industry. It demonstrates using NLP techniques to quickly parse and extract key information from long and complex regulatory filings.

The project will be presented at the Claude 2 hackathon. The chatbot will assist with analysis and summarization as the NLP component for this interesting application of natural language processing to financial regulatory documents.

## Create virtual environment

Create your project folder. Then create your virtual environment and activate it.

```console
cd my/project/folder
git clone [TODO: Insert repo link]
cd anthropic-sec-10k
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install dependencies

Pip install the required dependencies.

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Developer requirements, e.g. testing.
```

# Usage

You can either pass a list of CIK values directly, e.g.

```console
python -m src.main 0000320193 0000858877 0000796343
```

or else put them in `data/ciks.txt` and run the code as follows:

```console
python -m src.main

# Tests

## ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ˜‚

For a basic testing framework, run the following from the project's root directory after installing the developer requirements.

```console
pytest tests
```

The output should be similar to the following:
