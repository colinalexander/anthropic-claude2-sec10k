### Management's Discussion and Analysis

- Revenue increased 4.5% in 2019 primarily due to growth in supply chain and international package segments

- Operating profit grew 2.3% as higher revenues were partially offset by expansion costs, increased depreciation and lower gains on sales of real estate

- Domestic package volume expanded but revenue growth was constrained by lower fuel surcharges and changes in customer and product mix

- International operating margin declined due to unfavorable exchange rates and shifts in trade flows and customer demand

- Supply chain and freight revenue rose but operating profit decreased due to higher purchase transportation costs 

- Stock repurchases and dividends totaled $4.9 billion demonstrating ongoing commitment to shareowner returns

- Capital expenditures were $5.4 billion as ongoing investments were made in capacity expansion, aircraft, vehicles, facilities and automation

- Issued EUR 1.0 billion of notes to fund general corporate purposes including the redemption of higher coupon debt

- Operating cash flow decreased primarily due to higher pension contributions and working capital needs

- Debt levels increased to support capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions
